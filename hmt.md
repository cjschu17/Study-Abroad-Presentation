[Main scholion][sch1zoom]


> [The mark is here] because it is Homeric to understand [the word] “τίς” instead of [writing] “γνοίη τίς ἂν”. For it is also accustomed since the person is not being assumed; hence the word happens to be used in this way: “οὐδε κε φαίης” instead of “φαίη τίς ἂν.”

- Why are there two comments on this one line?
- What does this indicate about the source material for the various types of scholia?


***

#Present Work#

- Book 18: The Shield of Achilles 
- Many previously unanalyzed scholia

***

#Future Work#

- Finish creating a digital edition of the Venetus A Manuscript of the Iliad
- Questions to address statistically

	- Patterns in contents of scholia
	- Patterns in references to citations
	- Similarities and differences among manuscripts
